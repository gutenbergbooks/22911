<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time as four blind men sat by the roadside they heard
the tramp of an elephant&#8217;s feet, and said one to another, &ldquo;Here comes an
elephant; now we shall know what he is like.&rdquo; The first blind man put
out his hand and touched the elephant&#8217;s broad side. The second took hold
of a leg. The third grasped a tusk, and the fourth clutched the animal&#8217;s
tail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now do you know what an elephant looks like?&rdquo; asked a friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried the first. &ldquo;The elephant is broad and flat like a barn
door.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed the second. &ldquo;The elephant is big and round like
the trunk of a tree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so!&rdquo; cried the third. &ldquo;The elephant is hard and smooth like a
polished stone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you all talking about?&rdquo; cried the fourth. &ldquo;The elephant
is just like a piece of rope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Much so-called teaching of geography leads to just such incomplete and
fantastic ideas about geographical concepts. Very many children have
only vague, incomplete and incorrect conceptions of the things they see.
Like these physically and mentally blind men we are too often satisfied
with mere wordy descriptions of subjects when we might study the subject
at first hand if we would.</p>

<p>This little book is intended to prevent the giving of information by
description, but to suggest ways of directing attention to those things which
lie within reach of the child&#8217;s senses, things which he might pass by, things
which are needed now to stimulate an intelligent interest in his surroundings,
things which are needed later for an appreciation and enjoyment of
his study of the larger facts and concepts of geography. If the larger
geographical concepts are to have accuracy and richness for the child he
must have his attention directed to his surroundings. The trite expression
<a name="png.006" id="png.006"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">6</span><span class="ns">] </span>&ldquo;from the known to the unknown&rdquo; is good pedagogy, but there must be a
&ldquo;known&rdquo; on which to build.</p>

<p>The book is based upon the author&#8217;s actual experience in the class-room
studying the children at their geography tasks. It has been her experience
that the efforts of the teachers to build broad geographical concepts
were of no avail because the pupils did not have accurate intimate knowledge
of the necessary home geography upon which to build. To correct
this defect she set about collecting and classifying the necessary material.
With the use of this material she not only found that the class teachers
had much less difficulty in presenting the study of the earth as a whole,
but that an interest beyond all expectation was apparent in the children.</p>

<p>The following pages are valuable more on account of the things they
suggest than for any geographical facts which they incidentally present.
The book is not a text-book on geography; it is a compendium of suggestion
on the study of the subject. It makes little effort to present facts,
but rather it tells how to gather, classify and study facts. It is intended
to be used with children during the age when they especially delight in
the making of collections, and is intended to turn to a definite use this
childish instinct.</p>

<p>Map study is based entirely upon the child&#8217;s experiences as he makes
plans of his schoolroom, schoolhouse, streets and city. The suggestions
regarding the study of things foreign to the child are based entirely upon
his experience in the study of the types with which he has become familiar
in his study of his surroundings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Geographical</span> knowledge should progress from the known to the
unknown, from the familiar to the unfamiliar. The world is the home of
mankind. We can best understand the larger world by a preliminary
consideration of our own small intimate home. We therefore begin to
study geography with an account of the child&#8217;s immediate environment.
The school stands for the common home of the class. From the school we
gradually widen out our teaching to include the immediate neighborhood
with its buildings, and finally the whole town or community.</p>

<p>We study the various types of people whom we meet every day, and
the industries in which they engage in their efforts to obtain the three main
necessities of human life,&mdash;food, clothing and shelter. The animals and
plants sharing the world with man and contributing to his sustenance next
focus our attention.</p>

<p>The home neighborhood has its physiographical features distinguishing it
from other places and influencing the life of its inhabitants. The land and
water divisions in the immediate environment are studied as types, while
those not closely related to our home are reserved for consideration as each
one occurs in its local geographical place in the course of study.</p>

<p>We must know something of direction in order to conveniently locate
the streets, buildings and physiographical features near our home. Finally,
we will try to realize the great size of the earth, of which our home is but
a small portion, by a consideration of the relationship of our community
to the rest of the world and to some of this world&#8217;s great diversities.</p>

<p>As geography is a study of cause and effect, the early lessons should be
mainly oral. Later, in order to obtain a broad knowledge of geographical
data, not one but many books should be read. This little book aims to
serve as a bridge between the oral lesson and the descriptive text-book.
The presentation of many questions leads the pupil to think out cause and
effect, and to connect his present knowledge with the realm of the unknown.
Special care has been exercised to present facts only when facts are
<a name="png.008" id="png.008"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">8</span><span class="ns">] </span>absolutely necessary, and only after allowing the pupil the opportunity to first
exercise his own reasoning faculties in obtaining the information.</p>

<p>The excursion is an essential part of every geography course, and every
effort should be made to use this effective means of teaching.</p>

<p>Four types of valuable exercises may be suggested in the use of this
book:</p>

<p>1. The pupils may read the questions orally and give the answers
orally.</p>

<p>2. They may read the questions silently, answering them orally.</p>

<p>3. They may read the questions orally and write the answers.</p>

<p>4. Finally, they may silently read the questions and write the answers.</p>

<p>All definitions have been carefully avoided as tending to hamper the
free acquisition of ideas.</p>

<p>Now let us think of the garden and playground.
Tell about the different parts and the materials that

<p>What great numbers of workmen were needed

<p>Of all the many kinds of buildings in town or
country, the <em>houses</em> are the most important. It is
more necessary to have good homes to live in than to
have the other buildings large or beautiful. What
makes a good residence? There must be enough room
for the whole family. It needs plenty of light, air,
sunshine and water. It must have a good roof to keep
it dry in stormy weather. It should be well heated in
the cold winter. Tell of other things that are needed in
our homes to keep the family healthy and happy.
How can you help to make your home pleasant?</p>


<h4 class="secn">3</h4>

<p>The libraries and museums also teach people. A

 </span><em>library</em> is like a home where many friendly teachers
live. These friends will talk to you and tell you many
useful and wonderful things. Have you ever visited
them at the library? Have you ever taken any of
them home with you? Is there a library near our
school?</p>

<p>The <em>museums</em> are full of many interesting objects.
You may see beautiful pictures and statuary. Some
have collections of pretty stones and of stuffed animals.
Curious clothing, jewelry, toys and musical instruments
used by people in distant lands are shown too. In a
museum in Portland you may see the dear little clothing
worn by the poet Longfellow when he was a tiny
baby. Many books that Washington read are kept in
a museum near the city of Washington. Have you
ever visited a museum in a city? What did you see
there?</p>

<p>In town and country there are many ill people who
cannot be cared for at home. They go to <em>hospitals</em> to
be nursed back to health and strength. The good

cupola. If you have ever seen a Town Hall tell how it
looked.</p>

<p>It would be fine if all of the buildings in which
folks work were sunny, airy and clean. People employed
in comfortable stores and factories are happy
and feel like working.</p>

<p>Alas! there are many miserable places where the
workmen are crowded and uncomfortable. The impure
air makes them tired and ill. If you have seen a good
store or factory tell what helps to keep the workers
comfortable and healthy.</p>

<p>Old cities have in them many very old buildings
that all Americans love. The magnificent Capitol at
Washington was built long ago. It is one of the finest
buildings in the world. It is built of white marble.
In the first picture in this book notice the beautiful
dome and the great high stairs. In Philadelphia is the
dear old Independence Hall with the Liberty Bell.
Boston has the old Faneuil Hall. Here many great
Americans of long ago have spoken to the people. Are
there any old historic buildings in our neighborhood?</p>

clean and comfortable, or dirty, careless and unpleasant?
Do you want your clothing to be strong, neat
and pretty, or torn and dirty? We should all take
pride in having the things we own just as good as

public building, or in a park, say to yourself, &ldquo;This is

Many do not know how beautiful the bare trees look

is no more exquisite sight in the world than to see
these trees coated with glistening ice out to the tiniest

<p>Do we live in a large city, a small town or in the
country? What is the name of our town or the nearest
town? Who first settled in the place which has grown
to be a town? It is hard for us to believe that two
hundred and fifty years ago there were no houses,
churches, schools, streets or roads where we now live.
All this land was wild country, mostly woods. The
early settlers were strong and brave men. They had
to cut down the forests and build their first homes of
rough logs. Then they planted fields with corn,
wheat and vegetables. They killed the wild animals
for food, using the skins for clothing. As soon as
<a name="png.035" id="png.035"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">35</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>possible the settlers tried to build a small plain
church and a school-house.</p>

  /><br />COLUMBUS&#8217;S SHIP.</p>

<p>Now we have our fine towns which have grown from
the early work of these first sturdy settlers. All of
the people should love our dear home town and try to
make it beautiful, healthful and comfortable. We
should love our neighbors and treat them all like
brothers and sisters. If we are true to our village or
our dear town we will be kind and fair to all, rich and
poor, Americans and foreigners, white and colored
people. That is one way of showing our thankfulness
for our comfortable homes.</p>

<span class="subtitle">THE PEOPLE</span></h3>

<h4 class="secn">1</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Think</span> of the many buildings which you see as you
look over the landscape. There are people living in
nearly all of those houses. Just think of the many,
many people who live here. How many are there?
How many schools have we in the town? How many
people go to your school?</p>

<p>Most of these people look much alike, but some
are very different in appearance. Name some of the
different kinds of people whom you have seen. How
do you distinguish a negro and Chinaman or Mongolian
from a white person or Caucasian? Tell about
their hair, skin or any other peculiar features.</p>

<p>Each kind of people is called a race. The pictures
show some of the races we often see&mdash;Caucasian, Mongolian
and negro. The Chinese and Japanese are
called Mongolians.</p>

<span class="subtitle">THE INDIANS</span></h4>

<p>The Indians lived at this place which is now our
home long before there were any white people here or any
towns at all. Where these many buildings now stand
there was wild country, fields and woods. Under the
<a name="png.037" id="png.037"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">37</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>trees stood the Indian wigwams made of skins and
branches. The early settlers came to this country from
far across the ocean. After William Penn landed with
his companions he began at once to make friends with
the Indians. As the red men were living upon the
land, Penn thought that it was only fair and honest
to buy from them the land that the English people
wanted for their homes. The Indians could not use
money, so he gave them blankets and other presents
<a name="png.038" id="png.038"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">38</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>which pleased them very much. The Indians promised
William Penn to live in peace with the white
men and they kept their promise for many years.</p>

<p class="illus fltlt"><img class="framed" src="images/illus038.jpg"
  width="294" height="389" alt="" title=""
  /><br />INDIAN CHIEF.</p>

<p>Most of the white
people who came
in those early days
to other parts of
our land did not
act in this noble
way. When they
wanted land on
which to build their
homes they drove
the Indians away,
killing many of
them. Thus these
unjustly treated Indians
became the
enemies of the
white men, and
often treated them
very cruelly in return. Let us remember that the
Indians were the first owners of this land of ours and
that they should be treated as William Penn showed
us, with kindness and justice.</p>

<p>Those wild Indians of long ago had many noble
traits. They were strong and brave and fearless.</p>

<p class="note">Read in some of your school books about Indians and their homes.</p>

<p class="illus fltrt"><img class="framed" src="images/illus039.jpg"
  width="238" height="347" alt="" title=""
  /><br />NEGRO.</p>

<p>There were no negroes in this country till many
years after Columbus and the other white men began
to settle here. Some white men went far across the
sea to Africa. They stole
the negroes away from
their homes, carried them
to their ships and sailed
back to this country.
Then these white men
sold the negroes to other
men for money. The poor
colored men had to work
terribly hard as slaves
and received no pay for
their work. At last they
were freed by Abraham
Lincoln and others who
helped him.</p>

<p>The negroes have much
that is fine in their character.
Even when they were slaves they often grew
to love their masters so dearly that they would do
anything in the world, even give up their lives, for
their masters. We should always remember that God
made the negro as well as the white man. Fair-minded
people will try to be honest, kind and just to everyone.</p>

  /><br />CHINESE MANDARIN AND SERVANT.</p>

<p>Many Chinamen
have come to our
country from their
distant homes in
China. Their country
is so crowded,
and it is so hard
to earn a living
there, that most of
the people are very
poor.</p>

<p>The Chinese living
in our country
are peaceful and
quiet. They work
very hard in their
laundries and other places of business; yet there are
many white people so cruel and thoughtless as to ridicule
a Chinaman whenever they see one. These white
people should remember that God made the Chinaman
and that he is a stranger here in our country.
Is it not even worse to ill-treat a stranger than one
who is at home? The color of our skin and hair is
not very important. It matters far more whether we
are honest, loving, industrious and fair-minded.</p>

<p>Not all of the white people living around us were
born in this country. Where did your parents and
<a name="png.041" id="png.041"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span

know any people who came from distant lands? Where
were their first homes? Find out how many of the
parents of your schoolmates came a long journey over
the water to reach our land.</p>

<p>Yes, we have people from many foreign countries.
Some are English, Irish, Scotch or French. Then there
are the Germans, Italians, Russians and others. From
what country did each of these people come?</p>

<p>Here they are all living together, people from all
over the great wide world. Our homes stand side by
side. We work and play together. Truly we are
brothers and sisters, for we are all children in the great
human family. It matters not from what distant land
our people may have come, we should all be bound together
like one family by human love and kindness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Which</span> members of your family work? Why do
they work? For what is the money they earn spent?
Think which of these things are absolutely necessary
to keep us alive.</p>

<p>We all need <em>food</em>.</p>

<p>We all need <em>clothing</em>.</p>

<p>We all need <em>homes or shelter</em>.</p>

<p>Without these provisions we should die.</p>

<p>How do we get our food, our clothing and our

<span class="subtitle">THE SOIL</span></h4>

<p>We have two kinds of food, vegetable food, which
grows from the ground, and animal food. Name
some foods of each kind. All plants grow out of the
earth or soil. The soil is necessary to produce our
animal food also. The meat we eat comes from
sheep, cows, chickens and other animals. These animals
all live on vegetable food. Without good soil
<a name="png.043" id="png.043"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">43</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>there would be no grass nor hay. No grass would
mean no food for cows and sheep. So we see that all
of our food really comes from the soil.</p>

<p>Our clothing, too, is dependent upon the soil.
The cotton plant grows up out of the ground. The
wool comes from the sheep, which eats grass which
grows from the ground.

Even our homes could not be built without products
from the earth or soil. Think how much wood
is used in the construction of a house. The trees
which grow in the soil give us all the wood. Much
iron, steel, copper, brass and nickel are used in our
homes. Stones and bricks form part of many houses.
All of these things come out of the earth. What a
wonderful thing is the soil! Out of it come our
food, our clothing and our shelter!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Think</span> of the foods that you had on your dinner
table yesterday. Where did each come from? How
did it get here? Was there anything which came
from our own neighborhood, and which did not have
to take a long journey either to the factory where it
was manufactured or to the store where it was
sold?</p>

<p>Examine the clothing you are wearing. Of what
material is each article made? Where did the materials
come from? Where were they manufactured?
Which had to come a long journey before it reached
your home?</p>

<p>Look around the school-room and name the materials
which had to travel a long distance before we
could have them for our use.</p>

<p>Imagine trying to get our food, our clothing and
our shelter materials right near our school. How
much could we be sure of having?</p>


<h4 class="secn">2</h4>

<p>Perhaps you have seen products being brought
into the city. You may have seen the milk trains
unloading their many shining cans. Surely you
<a name="png.051" id="png.051"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">51</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>have seen the freight cars with their signs painted
on the outside telling that they are refrigerator cars,
or coal cars, or other kinds of cars. What do they
carry?</p>

<p>Most of the things we need are brought here
on <ins class="transcriber"
  title="Transcriber's note: period invisible in original">trains.</ins>
 Where is there in our neighborhood a
freight railroad station? Is it near our school?</p>

  /><br />CHINESE TRANSPORTATION.</p>

<p>Some products are taken from the country to
the town in wagons.
You have seen the
big hay wagons
which go a long
way from some
farm to take food
for the city horses.</p>

<p>How else are
products carried?
Coffee, rubber, pepper,
chocolate and
much silk are brought here from distant lands in
ships. If you go to the harbor of a large city you
can see hundreds of busy men unloading the big
steamers.</p>


<h4 class="secn">3</h4>

<p>Ships and railroads carry not only foods but people
too. There are many ways of carrying people
and products. These are some of the ways:</p>

<p><a name="png.052" id="png.052"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">52</span><span class="ns">]<br

<p>2. In wheelbarrows.</p>

  /><br />TRANSPORTATION IN ARABIA.</p>

<p>3. In wagons.</p>

<p>4. In automobiles.</p>

<p>5. In trolley cars.</p>

<p>6. In railroad
trains.</p>

<p>7. On boats, or
ships.</p>

<p>8. In sleighs.</p>

<p>9. On bicycles.</p>

<p>10. In airships.</p>

<p>In which of these
ways have you traveled?
Can you tell
what power is used
in each case?</p>

<p>In order to travel safely and quickly we need
more than something in which to carry the people
and products. We must have good wagon roads, well
built railroads, tunnels through the mountains, and
bridges over the rivers. Lighthouses are necessary
to warn the vessels of the rocks at night or in the
storms.</p>


<h4 class="secn">4</h4>

<p>When people need things from a distance they
cannot always go all the way to the place and bring
<a name="png.053" id="png.053"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">53</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>back the products or articles. It is quicker and
easier to send messages asking for what is needed.
How would your mother send an order to the butcher
for meat if she did not wish to go for it? How could
a farmer send a message to the city ordering new milk
cans and strawberry boxes? How do messages come
to your house?</p>

<p>In olden days the persons had to carry all of their
messages for themselves or send them by other persons.
The messenger would often run for miles without
resting so as to deliver the letters as soon as
possible. At last the people decided to give all of
their letters to a postman who would ride on horseback
from place to place with the mail. Stagecoaches
were next used. It took a week for a coach
to go as far as a train can go now in a few hours.
Our mail is now carried from one place to another by
trains or vessels, and then the letter carriers deliver it
at our city houses or to our town post office or rural
mail-box.</p>

<p>The quickest way to send a message is by cable,
telegraph, telephone or wireless message. Over the
electric wires or through the air the words are flashed
for miles in a few minutes.</p>

<span class="subtitle">HILL AND PLAIN</span></h4>

<p>Some streets and roads are flat and level. Others
slope like <em>hills</em>. Can you name a street which is level,
and one that slants or slopes? Which road is easier to
walk on? Why? Do you prefer the level or the sloping
street when roller-skating? Why? Which is the
best when you are coasting?</p>

<p>You may have noticed that some of the fields in
the park or in the country are nearly flat. Other
fields lie on slopes or hills. We call the flat part of
the land a <em>plain</em>, whether it is in the city or in the
country. The sloping part of the land forms a hill.
Have we mostly hills or plains in the streets of our
city?</p>


<h4 class="secn"><a name="png.055" id="png.055"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">55</span><span class="ns">]<br

<p>Some plains and some hills are covered with trees.
If you were in the woods, surrounded by trees, how
would you know whether you were on a plain or on
a hill?</p>

<p class="illus"><img class="framed" src="images/illus055.jpg"
  width="499" height="310" alt="" title=""
  /><br />HILLS AND VALLEYS.</p>

<p>Some hills look very different from others. Some
slope very gradually, while some are very steep.
Some hills have city streets on them. Others have
great fields of grass for cows to graze upon. Still
others are planted with corn, wheat, rye or vegetables.
There are wooded hills covered with trees.
How do we know that all of these very different
forms are hills?</p>

<p><a name="png.056" id="png.056"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">56</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>In the same way plains vary greatly. While some
have been made into city streets, others are large, flat,
grassy fields, with streams sometimes flowing through
them. Some plains are covered with forests. Others
are planted with grain and vegetables. How can you
know when you see a plain if there are so many different
kinds?</p>


<h4 class="secn">3</h4>

<p>Look through the pictures in this book and decide
which show hills and which show plains. Which is
easier for a farmer to plow, a hill or a plain? Why?</p>

<p>If you were sent upon an errand, would you choose
to go by way of a hilly road or by a level one? Which
is the pleasantest place for a summer home, upon a
hill or upon a plain?</p>

<p>How must a driver help his horses when they are
pulling a heavy load up or down a hill?</p>


<h4 class="secn">4<br />

<span class="subtitle">MOUNTAINS AND VALLEYS</span></h4>

<p>Some hills are so very, very high that they have
been called <em>mountains</em>. What are our neighboring
mountains named? Have you ever been to the top of
one of these mountains? Describe the beautiful view
from the summit. Did you see any wild creatures along
the way? Tell about any trees and other plants that
you noticed.</p>

<p><a name="png.057" id="png.057"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">57</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>When people build homes in mountain regions they
generally place them in the low land between the high
mountains. Why? This lower land is called a <em>valley</em>.
The people in the valley town can often look beyond
the fields and see the mountains rising high and steep
beyond. Some mountains are covered with trees. At
places you may see great bare, rough rocks on the
mountain side. The scenery is very beautiful. There
are often streams and broad rivers down in the valley.</p>

  /><br />THE UPPER DELAWARE.</p>

<p>Many lumbermen work on the mountains. Why do
they cut down the trees? The mountains give the
miners work too. The men go far into the mines to
bring out the useful minerals. Are there any mines
<a name="png.058" id="png.058"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">58</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>in the mountains near our home? What do the miners
take from these mines?</p>

<span class="subtitle">RIVERS</span></h4>

<p>What <em>river</em> flows near our home? Have you ever
seen it? Where were you when you saw it? How
did it look? What did you notice along its banks?
What was on the river? Was there any way of crossing
over to the opposite bank?</p>

<p><a name="png.059" id="png.059"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">59</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Did you see where the boats land? Men have built
many wharves on the banks of the rivers. If you stand
on the wharf, you may see great ferry-boats crowded
with people. Back and forth these boats go, carrying
the people from one side of the river to the other.</p>

<p>Sometimes great steamers come up the river. They
have carried people, food and clothing on a long journey.
Some boats are loaded with coal or lumber.
There are many pretty sailboats and rowboats too.
In some you will see fishermen. They bring the fish
back for the city people to eat.</p>

<p>Before the city was built there was beautiful country
all along the banks. If you travel up the river,
leaving the city far behind, you will see some fine
scenery. Perhaps you will pass beautiful woods.
Some of the trees bend over the river as if they were
looking at their reflections in the clear water. At
places there are broad fields where the cows come
down to drink the cool water. Farther up there are
hills or mountains rising far above the banks. You
will notice that the river is growing narrower and narrower
until it is but a small stream. If you go down
the river again, you will see that it gradually widens
as it flows on to the mouth.</p>

<p>Most cities get their water supply from a nearby
river. Do you know where the water in your bath-room
<a name="png.060" id="png.060"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">60</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>comes from? When you take a drink in our
school-yard what water are you swallowing? How
does this water get to our home and school? Pipes
run under the streets from the river to all the buildings
of the town. There are big pumping stations
on the river bank to pump the water out of the
river through pipes to the houses. Millions of gallons
of water
are pumped
each day into
the homes,
schools, mills
and factories.
For
what is this
water used?</p>


<h4 class="secn">7</h4>

<p>Plants need
more than good soil to make them grow. They will wither
and die unless they have plenty of rain to keep the earth
soft and moist. There are many places in the world
where no trees, nor grass, nor plants of any kind can
grow. This is because there is no water to wet the earth.</p>

<p>We all know that clouds bring the rain; but how
do the clouds get the water? Whenever there is
water on the earth, as in the rivers, the air is continually
drawing up the moisture in tiny invisible
<a name="png.061" id="png.061"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">61</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>drops. This moisture rises in the air and forms
clouds. When the clouds get very heavy, down comes
the water which we call rain. In cold weather it
is changed into snow.</p>

<p class="illus"><img class="framed" src="images/illus061.jpg"
    width="446" height="380" alt="" title=""
   /><br />ELEPHANT IN THE &ldquo;ZOO.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Where there is no moisture there can be no rain,
for the air cannot draw up moisture to form clouds.
Where there are many rivers there has been much rain,
and the soil is kept fertile. Plants will grow in it. Do
you see how our food, our clothing and our shelter are
dependent upon rainfall? Do you see how we are kept
alive by rivers?</p>


<h4 class="secn">8</h4>

<p>Think of the many, many uses of rivers. There
are thousands of useful rivers in the world.</p>

<p>Look at the map of our neighborhood. See the
lines that represent the river. Notice how it bends.
Does it show where bridges cross it?</p>


<h4 class="secn">10<br />

<span class="subtitle">THE OCEAN</span></h4>

<p>Have you ever stood on the beach and watched the
big waves roll in? The great <em>ocean</em> stretches away as
far as you can see. It seems to meet the sky. The
weaves roll and break, and roll and break from morning
till night forever. Where there are rocks along the
shore the ocean dashes against them. The sparkling
snowy spray then leaps high into the air with a boom
and a swish!</p>

  /><br />THE OCEAN.</p>

<p>As you sail up the river you may see large portions
of land lying right out in the water. There are pieces
of land lying out in the ocean too. The water lies
around them on all sides. We call such portions of
land <em>islands</em>. If you were standing on the shore how
could you go to an island which you saw out in the
water? How could you get there if you had no boat?
Some islands are joined to the shores by bridges.</p>

<p>Many islands are no larger than this room. Others
<a name="png.064" id="png.064"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">64</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>are so large that it would take days to travel around
them. Whether they are large or small they have
water entirely around them.</p>

<p class="illus"><img class="framed" src="images/illus064.jpg"
  width="355" height="311" alt="" title=""
  /><br />PART OF A ROCKY ISLAND.</p>

<p>Some of us have been to a large island that has
been built up into a city. When the New York boys
and girls want to leave their city they must either go
in a boat, or over a bridge, or through a tunnel far
under a river. Why? When you visit Atlantic City
your train goes over a bridge into the city. Why?</p>


<h4 class="secn">12</h4>

<p>Look at some pictures of islands and notice how
many kinds there are. Some are all wooded. Others
<a name="png.065" id="png.065"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">65</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>are covered with fields. Notice one that is rocky and
steep, and another that is level and built into a city.</p>

<p>Some islands are so large as to have many cities
built upon them, and there are many farms and dense
woods besides upon the same islands. Some have
many rivers flowing through them.</p>

<p>If you were on a large island, how could you prove
that it was an island? If you wanted to leave it, how
could you do so? Notice on the map of our neighborhood
whether a river with islands in it is shown.</p>


<h4 class="secn">13</h4>

<p>Sometimes a piece of land has water flowing only
part way around it. If you take a boat and try to go
all around it, you will come to a place where the boat
cannot go because there is land there. This land that
is nearly an island, but does not have the water completely
around it, is called a <em>peninsula</em>. Where have
you seen a peninsula?</p>

on which we live is not flat, but round like a ball. It
is so very large, and we see so small a part of it at one

<p>Look at all of the globes and maps in the room.
Find how the land and the water are shown. Can you
see any islands, any peninsulas? A tiny dot may
mean the whole city with hundreds of homes, factories
and other buildings. Do you remember how
we looked down on our town from a great height and
saw the many houses? Just think of a tiny dot
meaning all of our town.</p>

water will reach the ocean. This little black line
means all of that great broad river.</p>

<p>Why do we have such tiny things to represent such
great things?</p>

<p>See this land called North America. It would
take five days and nights in a fast express train
to travel straight across it.</p>


<h4 class="secn">4</h4>

<p>We can cut the globe in half and make a flat picture
of the two parts as they look when placed side by side.</p>

<p>Another name for the globe is sphere. &ldquo;Hemi&rdquo;
means &ldquo;half,&rdquo; so each half of the globe is called a
&ldquo;hemisphere.&rdquo;</p>

<p>One half is called the Eastern Hemisphere and the
other half the Western Hemisphere.</p>

<p>In the Western Hemisphere we have the Western
Continent, which is America. This Western Continent
is made of two grand divisions, North America and
South America. Why are they so named? We live
in North America. Find our city and the river
nearest to it. North America was joined to South
America by a narrow strip of land called the <em>Isthmus
of Panama</em>. Look at the map and think why millions
of dollars have been spent through many years to cut
through this isthmus. Now vessels can pass through
this Panama Canal.</p>


<p><a name="png.076" id="png.076"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">76</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Look at the map of the Western Hemisphere and
notice what it contains besides the Western Continent
of America. There is more water than land. This
water forms the great oceans.</p>

<p>Perhaps you have been to Atlantic City or some
other seashore place and have seen the Atlantic
Ocean. Do you remember the big waves which rolled
in on the sandy beach and the pretty white-caps far
out? Did you see the big nets drawn in full of hundreds
of fish? Perhaps you bathed in the ocean and
got your mouth full of water. It did not taste like the
water we drink, for it was salty. All of the water of the
ocean is salt water, but the water of rivers is fresh.</p>

<p>The oceans are very large. It would take us five
or six days and nights on a great steamer to cross to
the other side of the Atlantic Ocean. In what direction
should we go?</p>


<h4 class="secn">5</h4>

<p>On the western side of America there is another
great ocean, the Pacific Ocean. It has salt water like
the Atlantic Ocean, and it also is constantly in motion
with great waves.</p>

<p>North of North America, in the intensely cold
region, is the Arctic Ocean. Great masses of ice called
icebergs and ice floes are floating through this ocean.</p>

<p>Far south of South America is the Antarctic Ocean.
It does not touch South America. It too is in a cold
part of the world.</p>

<p>Do you know of any people who came here from
England, Ireland, France, Germany, Italy or Russia?
Their homes were in the Eastern Hemisphere. The
Eastern Hemisphere has a great mass of land called
the Eastern Continent. The Eastern Continent is composed
of three grand divisions, Europe, Asia and Africa.</p>

<p>Find the great island named Australia. That is
sometimes called the Australian Continent because it
is so large.</p>


<h4 class="secn">7</h4>

<p>The same oceans which are in the Western Hemisphere

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> parts of the earth do not have seasons such as
we have. If we should travel north we should find
the climate growing colder and colder. After a long
time we should come to a region of intense cold. The
ground would be covered with ice and snow all the
year through, both winter and summer. This most
northern part of the earth is called the North Pole.
The region around it is the North Frigid Zone. There
is a South Pole and a South Frigid Zone as cold as the
northern one. You can see where they are on the
diagram.</p>

<p>If we start from here and take a trip south we
find it constantly growing warmer. At last we come
to a place where it is extremely warm in both summer
and winter. That region is called the Torrid Zone
because &ldquo;torrid&rdquo; means &ldquo;hot.&rdquo; This hot zone extends
right around the middle part of the earth. The very
hottest part through the middle is the Equator.
Notice on the drawing that we live in a zone between
the very cold region, or Frigid Zone, and the very
warm region, or Torrid Zone. Our zone is called the
North Temperate Zone. We have here spring, summer,

Temperate Zones, and most of the great cities are in
these zones. People can work better here where we

are but half-civilized. Some are savage. As they do
not need large warm homes like ours, some live in small
huts made of the branches of trees, earth and straw.
A few of these homes together make a village. These
people get their food by hunting in the forest and fishing
in the rivers and ocean. They also eat the fruits
that grow wild in the forests. There are some cities
in the Torrid Zone, but none of them are very large.
These towns have been built mostly by the civilized
white people. The streets are often shaded with
beautiful palm trees. The buildings are generally
small, as the people live and work out of doors as

  /><br />AN ESKIMO FAMILY.</p>

<p>At the most northern part of the earth and at the
most southern part are regions of intense cold. The
earth is entirely covered with ice and snow all of the
year. The water is filled with masses of floating ice
and snow. Our coldest winter days are not nearly so
cold as the climate of the North and South Frigid
<a name="png.091" id="png.091"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span

is water.</p>

<p class="illus fltlt"><img src="images/illus091.jpg"

  /><br />ESKIMO BOY.</p>

<p>Of course no trees, nor grass, nor plants, nor
animals, nor people of
any kind can live in that
intense cold. At the
parts near the Temperate
Zones, where it is
slightly warmer, there are
some very small dwarfed
trees not more than a
foot or two high, and perhaps
a little moss. It is
here that the Eskimos
live; but most of the
North Frigid Zone and
the South Frigid Zone
is a stretch of frozen
whiteness on all sides,
with no living thing of
any kind. During the
summer the sun never sets, so that there is twilight
all night. In winter the sun never rises above the
horizon, so there are months of darkness.</p>

<p>These frozen lands are the regions through which
so many brave explorers have traveled trying to find
the most northern part called the North Pole, and the
most southern part, the South Pole. Many of these
<a name="png.092" id="png.092"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span

 </span>fearless men have never returned from the Frigid
Zones. They have starved or been frozen to
death.</p>

<p>At last, after trying for twenty-seven years, Robert
E. Peary, an American, reached the North Pole on
April 6, 1909. All Americans are very proud of this
brave, determined, fearless man, who would not stop
until he had done what he set out to do.</p>

<p>Roald Amundsen, a brave Norwegian, reached the
South Pole on December 14, 1911, after suffering many
hardships.</p>


<h4 class="secn">9</h4>

<p>Peary has written a book in which he tells about
his travels. Up in the north he met the Eskimos, who
belong to the Indian family. They live in snow houses
in the winter. In summer, which is also very cold, they
live in skin tents. These Eskimos dress in warm furs.
They have no schools nor churches, but they are a
kind and peaceful people. They are very good to the
white explorers in the north.</p>

<p>The Eskimo travels mostly on foot, but carries loads
on sledges drawn by dogs. The Eskimo&#8217;s dogs are his
best friends. Without them he could not manage to
carry home the animals he kills for food and clothing.
He also uses boats which he makes of skins.</p>

<p>Many of the Frigid Zone animals are covered with
heavy fur. Why?</p>

North Frigid Zone and far south into the Torrid Zone,
but most of it lies in the North Temperate Zone.
What plants and animals live in North America? It
is separated from Asia by a narrow strip of water called
Behring Strait. How did North America used to be

called a canal and not an isthmus?</p>

<p>Three great oceans wash the shores of North America.
Name
them. The
coast line is
very irregular.
Notice
on the map
that at places
part of the
ocean extends
far into
the land,
forming <em>gulfs</em>
and <em>bays</em>.
Hudson Bay,
Gulf of Mexico
and Gulf
of St. Lawrence
are
all parts of
which ocean?
The waves are not so high in the bays and gulfs as in
the open ocean. The land keeps off some of the wind.
Vessels that are waiting to be laden with cargo lie in
these sheltered gulfs and bays. Why?</p>

<p><a name="png.096" id="png.096"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">95</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>At many places along the shore the land juts out
into the ocean in <em>capes</em>. Many of these points of land
have special names. Look on the map for them.
There are light houses built on most of these capes to
warn the ships in the dark and in the storms to keep
away from the dangerous rocks and shore. A cape is
often a pleasant place for a summer home. There is
so much water around it that the sea breezes sweep
across it and make it delightfully cool.</p>


<h4 class="secn">4</h4>

<p>Do you remember how we spoke of the river with
its many boats and steamers? There are hundreds
of rivers in North America flowing for miles until at
last they reach the ocean.</p>


<h4 class="secn">5</h4>

<p>There are many high hills, some so very high as
to be called <em>mountains</em>. There is a chain of these
mountains called the Eastern Highlands along the
eastern part of North America. They extend for
many miles north and south. The scenery in this
region is very beautiful. The mountains are covered
mostly with forests of pine, spruce, oak, maple, chestnut
and other trees. These are cut down for lumber.
In the wilder parts of these forests live squirrels, rabbits,
bears and snakes. At places the trees have been
cut down to make room for fields of grain.</p>

 /></span>The mountains are full of useful minerals. Great
quantities of coal and iron are mined in the Eastern
Highlands.</p>


<h4 class="secn">6</h4>

<p>The highest mountains in North America are the
Western Highlands in the western part. One great
chain or range extends the entire length of North
America from the Arctic Ocean down into South
America. Great forests grow on these mountains.
In many places are huge masses of rock on which
nothing grows, so this range has been called the Rocky
Mountains. It is always bitter cold at the top of some
of these mountains because they reach so high. Even
in summer they are capped with snow. Nowhere in
the world can more magnificent scenery be found.</p>

<p>West of the Rocky Mountains is the Pacific Mountain
System.</p>

<p>Gold and silver are mined in the Western Highlands.
In the wild parts of the forests, where no
people live, deer, wolves and bears may be found.</p>


<h4 class="secn">7</h4>

<p>The low land between the mountains we call <em>plains</em>
or <em>valleys</em>. There is a Great Central Plain which
reaches from the Eastern Highlands to the Western
Highlands. There are many rivers in this valley.
The Mississippi and the Missouri Rivers are the
largest.</p>


<h4 class="secn"><a name="png.099" id="png.099"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">98</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>8</h4>

<p>You remember how rivers make rainfall and fertile
soil. The Great Central Plain has some of the best
farm land in the world. In the northern cold part
hardly anything grows, but in the central part great
quantities of corn, grain, fruits and vegetables are
raised. In the south the plantations or farms raise
sugar cane, cotton, tobacco, rice and coffee.</p>

<p class="illus"><img class="framed" src="images/illus099.jpg"
  width="503" height="314" alt="" title=""
  /><br />SHEEP ON THE PLAINS.</p>

<p>On the western plains great herds of thousands of
sheep and cattle are raised.</p>

<p>In the Great Central Plain are hundreds of cities
where the farm products are sold. Here, too, the
farmers buy the farm tools and machinery which they
<a name="png.100" id="png.100"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">99</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>need. In the city mills the wheat is ground into flour
and the logs from the forests are sawed into planks or
made into furniture. The cattle and sheep are killed
and the meat prepared for our use.</p>


<h4 class="secn">9</h4>

<p>East of the central part of the Great Central Plain
are five of the largest lakes in the world. When you
are in a boat in the middle of any one of them you
cannot see the land on any side. They are called the
Great Lakes. Their names are Superior, Michigan,
Huron, Erie and Ontario. They are all joined together,
and from the last a large river runs into the
Gulf of St. Lawrence. It has the same name as the
gulf.</p>

<p>There are many other smaller lakes in North
America where the land is low and the water from the
rivers and streams fills up the hollows. Nearly all
have fresh water like the rivers. A very few, like
Great Salt Lake, contain salt water.</p>

<span class="subtitle">COUNTRIES OF NORTH AMERICA</span></h3>

<h4 class="secn">1</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">North</span> America contains several different countries.
Each is under a separate government. These countries
are United States, British America, Danish America,
Mexico and Central America. Each country has its
own ruler and its own laws. Each has a special flag
and its own kind of money and postage stamps.</p>


<h4 class="secn">2<br />

<span class="subtitle">THE UNITED STATES</span></h4>

<p>We live in the best one of these countries, for we
have the best ways of obtaining our food, our clothing
and our shelter. Our climate is good, for we are in
the North Temperate Zone. Our soil is very fertile.
The Great Central Plain of North America passes
through the central part of the United States. We
raise fruits, vegetables, corn, wheat, rice and sugar for
food. We have immense ranches for raising cows and
sheep too. Our clothing is supplied by the thousands
of sheep we raise and from the cotton we grow here.
The Western and Eastern Highlands pass through our
country.</p>

Why? Right in our own United States is found nearly
everything that is necessary to make us comfortable
and happy.</p>

<p>We have hundreds of towns with homes, factories,
schools, hospitals and churches. Over every public
building floats our beautiful flag, the Stars and Stripes.</p>

<p>Our laws are made in the capital, which is named
Washington, after George Washington, our first president.
Find Washington on the map. How long
would it take to go to Washington from our home?
<a name="png.104" id="png.104"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span

 </span>It is a beautiful city. The Capitol building is one of
the finest in the world. The President of the United
States lives in the White House.</p>

<p>Alaska, in the north-west, and the island of Porto
Rico, in the south-east, belong to the United States.
We own other islands in
other parts of the world.</p>

<p><em>British America</em> is our
next neighbor on the
north. It includes all
of the Dominion of Canada
and the Island of
Newfoundland. It belongs
to England or Great
Britain in Europe.</p>

<p>The Great Central Plain
and the Western Highlands
pass through it, and
yet it is not a rich country with many people like the
United States. Can you tell why?</p>

<p>There are large crops of fruit and grain in the
southern part only of British America. In this part
only are there any large cities. The few people in the
northern part go there to hunt the animals for furs
and to find gold. Many whales live in the cold waters
of the Atlantic Ocean and Hudson Bay. Are they of
use to man?</p>

<p><em>Danish America</em> is the name given to the two
islands Greenland and Iceland, because they belong
to Denmark, a country of Europe.</p>

<p>Greenland lies in which zones? What kind of
climate has it? A few white people and some Eskimos
live in the southern part. The northern part has no
life at all.</p>

<p>What do you know of the people, the plants and
the animals of this region?</p>

<p>In what zone is Iceland? Why is the climate very
cold? Many fish are caught in the ocean around Iceland.
The people on the island are able to raise little
but grass to feed their sheep and cattle.</p>

<p>There are many mountains in Iceland. Some of
them send out steam and melted rock and are called
<em>volcanoes</em>.</p>


<h4 class="secn">5</h4>

<p><em>Mexico</em> is our southern neighbor. This country has
a president and a government somewhat like ours.</p>

<p>Both Indians and white people live in Mexico.
The climate is so warm in the valleys that the people
living there cannot work so hard as they do in the
United States. So they do not have large factories
and many fine schools, hospitals and libraries as we
have. Why do they not build these on the mountains
where the climate is pleasant?</p>

<p>They have large plantations where they raise
<a name="png.106" id="png.106"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">104</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>rubber, sugar, cotton, coffee, tobacco and fruit and
many cattle.</p>

<p>The great Western Highlands extend down through
Mexico, and silver, copper and coal are mined in them.
Some of these mountains are volcanoes. What does
this mean?</p>


<h4 class="secn">6</h4>

<p>Central America is still warmer than Mexico. It
is entirely in what zone? The plants and animals are
much like those of Mexico.</p>


<h4 class="secn">7</h4>

<p>The West Indies consist of many islands. The
largest are Cuba, Haiti, Jamaica and Porto Rico.
Which belongs to the United States? These islands
have a warm climate. What do you think is raised
on the plantations by the white people and negroes?</p>

<p>The West Indies separate a part of the ocean from
the main Atlantic Ocean. This smaller part is called
the <em>Caribbean Sea</em>. Notice what countries it touches.</p>
